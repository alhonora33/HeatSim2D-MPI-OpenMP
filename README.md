# HeatSim2D-MPI-OpenMP
This project simulates heat transmission in a 2D solid using numerical methods. Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied, with iterations continuing until steady-state is reached ( 𝜖 ϵ criterion). OpenMP handles shared memory parallelism, while MPI distributes the workload across nodes, ensuring efficient large-scale computation.
